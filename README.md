# XGBoost_Tuning_with_HyperOpt_and_MLflow_Tracking

### Intro:

### Requirements:


```XGBoost:``` XGBoost is a popular machine learning library that provides scalable and efficient implementations of gradient boosting algorithms. It is designed to be highly customizable and provides a number of hyperparameters that can be tuned to improve performance.

```MLflow:``` MLflow is an open-source platform for the complete machine learning lifecycle, which includes tracking experiments, packaging code into reproducible runs, and sharing and deploying models. It provides a simple interface for logging and tracking machine learning experiments and is designed to work with any machine learning library.

```Hyperopt:``` Hyperopt is a popular open-source hyperparameter tuning library. It provides a range of algorithms for searching over a hyperparameter space, including random search, Bayesian optimization and tree-structured Parzen estimators.

```pandas:``` Data analysis and manipulation tool.
